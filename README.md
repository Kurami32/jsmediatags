# JS MediaTags

This is a Fork with all the dependencies removed, so you can just import the Javascript directly where you want to work without all the depencies that got downloaded automatically. 

This is intended for use only on web browser environments, cuz there you don't need those dependencies, like xhr2 (on browsers you don't need this, the browser itself can read the HTML requests + this package outdated), etc.

For documentation or issues, please, refer to the [Original Repository](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags)
