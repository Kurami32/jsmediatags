# JS MediaTags

This is a Fork with all the dependencies removed, so you can just import the Javascript directly where you want to work without all these outdated dependencies. 

This is intended for use only on web browser environments, cuz there you don't need any of these dependencies (like node, xhr2, etc).

For documentation, please, refer to the [Original Repository](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags)
